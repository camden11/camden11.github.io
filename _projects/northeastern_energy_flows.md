Northeastern Energy Flows was a research project run by Northeastern University professor Kristian Kloekl. The project sought to use the university as a small-scale model to visualize energy consumption, and through that, human activity, in an urban area. While I did not work on the actual research project, I developed a preliminary prototype of the visualization using Java and Processing. My program took data from a CSV file with power usage information for every 15 minute interval in 2014. The visualization displayed a map of the campus and used color to denote the energy usage in each building. Users could use a scroll bar to travel through time and view energy consumption at any of the 15 minute intervals.

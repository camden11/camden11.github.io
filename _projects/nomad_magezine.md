Nomad is a student run magezine at the University of Edinburgh that publishes articles pertaining to travel, culture, and politics, as well as works of creative writing. I got involved with the organization through the University's Design Society, and have been working to design and develop them a new website to replace their current WIX site. This project is currently a work in progress, and should be finished some time in December 2016.
